# Lilypad

My notetaking and homework setup built on top of Markdown Preview Enhanced and LaTeX in VSCode.

## Structure

- `.crossnote` - config files for Markdown Preview Enhanced
- `./mit` - notes from my time at MIT

## TODO

[ ] Port notes from Inkdrop / Notion
[X] Add good image support and the rest of the admonitions
[ ] Add my LaTeX macros to KaTeX config
[ ] Add script to automatically add rendered PDFs (maybe as a precommit hook?)
[ ] Add some of the LaTeX config files / homework stuff (keep rest in private subrepo)
[ ] Build extension for displaying files in custom date order depending on front matter in Markdown files
[ ] Create something to be able to easily specify some files / directories are private and automatically have them only added to private repo
[ ] Build PDF viewer and annotator
