<body><h1>Distributed Transactions</h1>
<h2>Paper Notes</h2>
<h3>Before-Or-After Atomicity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Previously, we talked about coordination via sequence coordination<ul>
<li>This says that Action W must happen before Action X for correctness</li>
<li>Usually explicitly programmed using special language constructs or shared variables<ul>
<li>I.e. use locks / semaphores to enforce specific ordering of operations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Before-or-after atomicity is a more general constraint that several actions acting on the same data should not interfere with one another<ul>
<li>Definition: concurrent actions have the before-or-after property if their effect from the invokers is the same as if the actions occurred either completely before or completely after one another</li>
<li>The programmer of an action with the before-or-after property does not necessarily know all other actions that might use shared variables</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another way of saying this is that the results must be serializable</li>
<li>The important distinction is that sequence coordination says two actions must be entirely separate while before-or-after says that they can occur at the same time and have interleaved instructions, but they must have the same state at the end</li>
<li>In some applications, we may want stronger correctness requirements:<ul>
<li>External time consistency means that if we have receipts that one action happened before another, then the serialization order must obey this (something like linearizability)</li>
<li>Sequential consistency means that when a processor performs multiple instructions from the same source, the result should be the same as if the instructions were in the original order</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Simple Locking</h3>
<ul>
<li>A locking discipline</li>
<li>Two rules:<ul>
<li>Each transaction must acquire a lock for every shared data object it intends to read / write</li>
<li>It may release its locks only after the transaction installs its last update</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A transaction has a lock point, which is the first instant at which it has acquired all of its locks<ul>
<li>The collection of locks it has acquired is its lock set</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A lock manager can be used to maintain the current lockset and intercept variable accesses to verify that they are in the current lockset<ul>
<li>Also intercepts calls to commit / abort so it can then release all locks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can miss some opportunities for concurrency by unnecessary locking<ul>
<li>Two operations that both want to read cannot be made concurrent</li>
<li>Also we lock every variable that we <strong>might</strong> need to read, so we could get extra performance by only locking what we will actually read</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Two Phase Locking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Another locking discipline avoids the requirement that a transaction must know in advance which locks to acquire</li>
<li>Widely used, but harder to argue it is correct</li>
<li>A transaction acquires locks as it proceeds, and it may read / write a data object as soon as it acquired a lock<ul>
<li>A transaction may not release any locks until it passes its lock point (acquired all of its locks)</li>
<li>Number of locks acquired monotonically increases and then decreases (which is where two phases comes from)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Orders concurrent transactions so they produce results as if they had been serialized in the order in which they reached their lock points</li>
<li>A lock manager can implement by intercepting all calls to read / write and acquiring a lock on the first use of each shared variable<ul>
<li>Holds the locks until the commit / abort occurs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Potentially allows for more concurrency than simple locking, but there are still cases where it prevents some concurrency</li>
</ul>
<h3>Multiple-Site Atomicity / Distributed Two-Phase Commit</h3>
<ul>
<li>We previously talked about atomicity / concurrency where we have several processes running on the same system</li>
<li>Now we look at executing component transactions at several sites separated by a best-effort network (i.e. the Internet)<ul>
<li>Atomicity is difficult because messages used to coordinate transactions can be lost / delayed / duplicated</li>
<li>We could use RPCs to execute target code but it doesn&#39;t by itself guarantee atomicity<ul>
<li>Even if we use persistent senders (at-least-once execution) and duplicate suppression (at-most-once execution), this isn&#39;t guaranteed to work as shown below</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instead we use a variant of two-phase commit combined with persistent senders, duplicate suppression, and single-site transactions</li>
<li>We assume that each site is capable of local transactions that satisfy all-or-nothing atomicity and before-or-after atomicity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple-site atomicity is correct iff all sites do the same thing (either they all commit or they all abort)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Description</h4>
<ul>
<li>Suppose A wants to send jobs X, Y, Z to be performed by B, C, and D<ul>
<li>Either all of these are done or none of them are done</li>
<li>Can&#39;t just use RPCs raw because some could perform the action while others don&#39;t</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedure:<ul>
<li>A first sends each B, C, D the instruction to do X, Y, Z respectively</li>
<li>B, C, D respond saying that they are ready to commit</li>
<li>When A receives all responses, they respond to everyone to tell them to prepare to commit</li>
<li>B, C, D then tentatively commit and ask A if they have decided to commit<ul>
<li>If they don&#39;t receive a response, then they continue asking A</li>
<li>They cannot do anything on their own and instead must wait for a response from A</li>
<li>They go into a &quot;Prepared&quot; state</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A then responds that they have committed<ul>
<li>They must remember that they have committed forever because if B, C, D ask again if they have committed, then A has to respond again</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>B, C, D then commit and then can switch out of Prepared state</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Resilient against temporary failures</li>
<li>Some versions have a fourth acknowledgment record so that A can know when to throw out its outcome record</li>
<li>After A commits, then they know that B, C, D will eventually get their result when they reboot / recover from failure</li>
<li>This system has the coordinator as a single point of failure<ul>
<li>The coordinator has to decide when to abort the operation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This system cannot coordinate actions to happen at the same time (Two General&#39;s Paradox)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lecture Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>So far, we&#39;ve covered distribution for fault tolerance<ul>
<li>Many servers trying to look like a single one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now we want to use many servers for performance<ul>
<li>We can split the data (shard) over multiple servers for parallelism</li>
<li>Fine as long as clients use data items one at a time</li>
<li>But what if an operation involves records in different shards?<ul>
<li>Need to perform a distributed transaction</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Correct behavior for a transaction: ACID<ul>
<li>Atomic (either writes entirely or doesn&#39;t write at all)</li>
<li>Consistent</li>
<li>Isolated (No interference between actions (serializable))</li>
<li>Durable (Committed writes are permanent)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once we have ACID transactions, it&#39;s like its magic<ul>
<li>Programmer writes serial code and system automatically adds correct locking / fault tolerance</li>
<li>We do get a performance hit from transactions and some don&#39;t</li>
<li>SQL databases provide transactions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A transaction can abort if something goes wrong<ul>
<li>Result should be as if the transaction never executed</li>
<li>Application can decide whether they want to retry</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Distributed Transactions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two components:<ul>
<li>Concurrency Control - isolated, serializable execution of concurrent transactions on a single DB<ul>
<li>Two types: pessimistic and optimistic<ul>
<li>Pessimistic: locks records before use, so any concurrent accesses cause delays</li>
<li>Optimistic: use records without locking, when we commit, we check if the reads / writes were serializable<ul>
<li>If we learn that our reads / writes were bad, then we abort and retry</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pessimistic is faster if conflicts are frequent, optimistic is faster if rare</li>
<li>We&#39;ll look at optimistic concurrency control another time (FaRM)</li>
<li>Two-phase locking above is one way to implement pessimistic concurrency control<ul>
<li>See above</li>
<li>Some extra details:<ul>
<li>Each database record has a lock</li>
<li>DB may automatically abort to cure deadlock (has to automatically detect these i.e. through cycles or timeout)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Atomic Commit<ul>
<li>Two-phase commit works by having a transaction coordinator (TC) managing the operation<ul>
<li>Bad reputation:<ul>
<li>Multiple rounds of messages</li>
<li>Slow disk writes</li>
<li>Locks are held between messages, blocking actions</li>
<li>TC crashes can cause indefinite blocking with locks held</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usually only used in a single small domain</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2PC is for ensuring every participant has to do something, but that something is different among all of them<ul>
<li>On the other hand, Raft is used to get high availability, so it solves a different problem</li>
<li>Each of the servers can run Raft to combine both distributed commits and high availability</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
